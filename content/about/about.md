Hi, I’m Hugo Esparza, a university student majoring in Computer Science. I’m passionate about the fascinating world of data and the endless possibilities it offers.  

Currently, I’m diving deep into data engineering and backend development, while also exploring areas like data analysis, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.  

This blog is my personal space to document and share what I’m learning along the way.
